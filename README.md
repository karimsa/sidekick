## Release channels

 * `nightly`: nightly releases are the tip of `develop` - these can include incomplete features, so be afraid.
 * `beta`: refers to the tip of `main` - these should be complete features, but not tested by end users yet.
 * `stable`: the latest tagged commit, will be published to npm.
